Athor: Sam Pearson-Smith

This is a basic graphics engine to learn about the rendering pipeline. It likely will not have any main usage outside of demo projects but I would like to add as many features as possible:
-Draw Triangles
-Draw Complex Mesh
-Flat Shade Colouring
-Texture Mapping
-Parallax Textures
-Phong Shading
-Guord Shading
-Shadow Mapping
-Dynamic Lighting
-Point, Directional, Targeted(Conical) Lighting
-On the fly shader writing and compilation
-etc...
